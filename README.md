### getposix.sh
This script generates a C program which lists all the compile time posix constants

### getsc.sh
This script generates a C program which lists all run time sysconf constants

### getconst.sh
This script outputs a list of matching pattern in a included header file (recursively checks in included files in header).
This is useful to get constants defined in an header without knowing which file its actually defined in.
